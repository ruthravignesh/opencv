# OpenCV Project

This project utilizes OpenCV to demonstrate computer vision techniques such as image processing, motion detection, or object recognition. Customize this description based on your project's specific functionality.

---

## Features
- **Image Processing:** Includes operations like blurring, edge detection, and thresholding.
- **Motion Detection:** Identifies movement in video streams.
- **Object Recognition:** Detects and highlights specific objects in images or videos.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Processes video feeds in real-time (if applicable).

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **OpenCV 4.x**
- **Numpy**

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencv-project.git
   cd opencv-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up any required configuration:**
   If the project uses external files (e.g., pre-trained models), ensure they are downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory. Specify the paths in the project code or configuration file.

---

## Running the Project

1. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Provide input data (if required):**
   - For image processing: Place input images in the specified folder.
   - For video analysis: Ensure the camera is connected or provide a video file.

3. **View Results:**
   The processed output will be displayed on-screen or saved to the output directory, depending on your project's implementation.

## How It Works

1. **Image Processing:**
   - Applies various filters and transformations to images.
   - Example: Edge detection using the Canny algorithm.

2. **Motion Detection:**
   - Compares frames in a video stream to identify areas of motion.
   - Example: Highlights moving objects.

3. **Object Recognition:**
   - Uses pre-trained models or custom algorithms to detect objects.
   - Example: Face detection using Haar cascades.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Any other libraries used (e.g., Matplotlib, TensorFlow, etc.)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **OpenCV installation errors:** Ensure pip is updated (`pip install --upgrade pip`) and retry.
- **Missing dependencies:** Verify all required libraries are installed via `pip freeze`.
- **Runtime errors:** Check paths for input/output files and configurations.
